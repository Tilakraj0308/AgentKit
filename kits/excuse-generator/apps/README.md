**Agent Kit Excuse Generator** is an AI-powered excuse generation system built with [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai). It uses intelligent workflows to generate personalized excuses based on the situation and person, through a modern Next.js interface. It remembers your personal context and the excuse history so that you don't repeat the same excuses for a person.
